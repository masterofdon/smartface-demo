                <h1>ROCK-SCISSORS-PAPER</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Rock–paper–scissors<b>
                            (also known as scissors-paper-rock or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player
                            simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a
                            closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle
                            finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating
                            "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in
                            the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for
                            one player and a loss for the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes
                    "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper
                    will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game
                    is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and
                    spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.
                    Other names for the game in the English-speaking world include roshambo and other orderings of the three
                    items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The players usually count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"),
                    each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They
                    then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only
                    three counts before throwing their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a
                    version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".
